# Data release

This folder contains data to be released with "A generative model for inorganic
materials design". The top-level directories and their contents are as follows:

* [`cifs`](cifs): A zipped folder containing CIF data files for crystal structures presented in the paper.
* [`alex-mp`](alex-mp): Alex-MP dataset used to train and fine-tune MatterGen.
* [`mp-20`](mp-20): MP-20 dataset (this dataset is not released with this repository and provided for convenience in reproducing our results).
* [`nanoindentaion_measurements`](nanoindentaion_measurements): CSV file containing the load-depth profiles for 4 nanoindentation measurements on the TaCr2O6 sample.
* [`xrd_measurements`](xrd_measurements): Contains the measured XRD profile (xrd_measurement_TaCr2O6.dat) and the Rietveld refinement FullProf file (Rietveld_refinment_TaCr2O6) for the TaCr2O6 sample.
* [`xps_measurements`](xps_measurements): Contains the XPS scan raw files of the TaCr2O6 sample in .vgd format for the whole spectra and all the peaks.
