# MatterGen Utilities and Results

**Note:** This repository is a fork and includes modifications to the [original MatterGen project](https://github.com/microsoft/mattergen). It provides additional utility functions and  showcases some MatterGen inference results

#### Hugging Face Mirror Checkpoints

This fork also allows checkpoint downloads from a Hugging Face mirror, to facilitate use of MatterGen in environments where direct access to Hugging Face is restricted. Please refer to the relevant directories within the repository for these checkpoint files.

*Refer to the README in the main folder for a quick start.*

## Utility Functions

This repository includes several utility functions to streamline working with MatterGen:

* **Interactive Structure Visualizer:** Visualize atomic structures in 3D using py3Dmol.
* **Structure Data Parser:** Parse and process structure data from `.extxyz` files, extracting information like atom count, lattice parameters, and atom types.
* **Structure Selection and Visualization:** Select specific structures from parsed data, write them to files, and visualize them.
* **Filtering and Analysis:** Filter structures based on criteria like atom count, atom types, etc.

**Usage:**

For detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the function documentation within the code.

## MatterGen Results

The `/lisa/results` directory contains the output generated by MatterGen inferences. This includes:

* **Generated structures:** Files in `.extxyz` format representing the predicted crystal structures.
* **Zipped CIFs:** Compressed `.cif` files containing detailed crystallographic information for each structure.
* **Trajectories:** Compressed `.extxyz` files capturing the atomic positions during the MatterGen simulation or optimization process.
