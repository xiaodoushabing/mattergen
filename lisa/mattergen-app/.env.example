# .env.example - Place a copy named .env in the project root and fill in your values.
# Variables used by the backend, Docker, or scripts.

# --- Port Configuration (Ports INSIDE the container network) ---
# These are the ports the services listen on *within the Docker network*.
CONTAINER_MONGO_PORT=27017
CONTAINER_BACKEND_PORT=8080 # Backend listens on this port inside its container
CONTAINER_FRONTEND_PORT=3000 # Vite dev server listens on this port inside its container

# --- Host Port Mappings (Informational - primarily for docker-compose.yml) ---
# These are the ports on your HOST machine that map to the CONTAINER ports.
# These are not typically used by the application code *inside* the container directly,
# but are essential for your docker-compose.yml file.
HOST_MONGO_PORT=27017
HOST_BACKEND_PORT=8080 
HOST_FRONTEND_PORT=3000

# --- Database Configuration ---
# For MongoDB credentials, uncomment and set these in your actual .env file
# MONGO_ROOT_USER=<your_mongo_admin_user>
# MONGO_ROOT_PASS=<your_mongo_admin_password>
DB_NAME=mattergen

# MongoDB Connection URL
# Replace 'mongo_container_name' with your MongoDB service name if using Docker, or 'localhost' for local MongoDB.
# The ${HOST_MONGO_PORT} expansion is typically handled by Docker Compose or a startup script, not directly by .env parsers.
# If not using such a tool, construct the full URL in your application code or set it directly.
MONGO_URL=mongodb://mongo_container_name:${CONTAINER_MONGO_PORT}/${DB_NAME}
# Example for local MongoDB without Docker:
# MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/mattergen

# --- Vite Frontend Specific Variables ---
# If any variables are needed by the frontend (e.g., API URL),
# they MUST be prefixed with VITE_ in your actual .env file.
# Example for frontend to know the backend API base URL:
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:${CONTAINER_BACKEND_PORT}/api
