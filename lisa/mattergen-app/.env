# .env - Actual configuration values for your local development environment.
# Do NOT commit this file if it contains sensitive credentials.

# --- Port Configuration (Ports INSIDE the container network) ---
# These are the ports the services listen on *within the Docker network*.
CONTAINER_MONGO_PORT=27017
CONTAINER_BACKEND_PORT=8080 # Backend listens on this port inside its container
CONTAINER_FRONTEND_PORT=3000 # Vite dev server listens on this port inside its container

# --- Host Port Mappings (Informational - primarily for docker-compose.yml) ---
# These are the ports on your HOST machine that map to the CONTAINER ports.
# These are not typically used by the application code *inside* the container directly,
# but are essential for your docker-compose.yml file.
HOST_MONGO_PORT=27017
HOST_BACKEND_PORT=8080
HOST_FRONTEND_PORT=3000

# --- Database Configuration ---
# If you have authentication enabled for your local MongoDB, uncomment and set these.
# Otherwise, for a default local MongoDB setup without auth, these can remain commented.
# MONGO_ROOT_USER=your_local_mongo_user
# MONGO_ROOT_PASS=your_local_mongo_password
DB_NAME=mattergen

# MongoDB Connection URL
# For a local MongoDB instance without authentication:
MONGO_URL=mongodb://mongo:${CONTAINER_MONGO_PORT}/${DB_NAME}
# If your local MongoDB has authentication, use:
# MONGO_URL=mongodb://${MONGO_ROOT_USER}:${MONGO_ROOT_PASS}@localhost:${HOST_MONGO_PORT}/${DB_NAME}?authSource=admin

# --- Vite Frontend Specific Variables ---
# Variables prefixed with VITE_ are exposed to your frontend code.
# This allows the frontend to know where the backend API is.
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:${CONTAINER_BACKEND_PORT}/api
